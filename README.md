# Unique-Password Generator 


## Description

The Password Generator was created to offer anyone in need of a unique, exceptionally secure, and totally randomly generated password.

 A limitless amount of potential passwords can be generated for any user simply by visiting the website, and answering a few breif questions. This offers any user the abitlity to have a security in their passphrase that they would likely not have if created on their own. It also removes the difficutly of creating ones own secure password, or of using the same password for multiple applications, thus lessening security.

## Table of Contents

 Not necessary. <!--I dont believe a table of contents are necessary here. If I have this wrong however please correct me.:/} -->

## Testing

While creating this program, I tested my code very little. I spent most of this project working closely with a detail oriented tutor, who thoroughly guided and helped me understand every line of code I created with her. Creating this program solely on my own was not feasable, as the concepts I have learned, I have only just barely been able to learn to read. Working together was the most fruitful way for me to understand what I needed to do and how I needed to think. 
Any testing was done by using the inspect tool and referring to the console. In specific I looked at how the arrays were being saved in memory, and how many special caracters were made available depending on the users choice of the password length.
